# TblDump

This program helps view/dump the graph format function pointer table used by the `0x7e` token in TI-BASIC. It tells you the necessary token hex value after `0x7e` (v=??), the index calculated from that value, and the pointer in the table it points to.

Left/right to change pages, clear to exit.
